## README
This folder contains the per-frame ego vehicle information for our model **PGS_all** across all 220 routes. The data includes ego position (e.g., `location`, `rotation`), sensor signals (e.g., `speed`, `steer`, `throttle`, `brake`), predicted traffic light states, driving commands, and other relevant details.

Following the instructions in the [Metric section of the Eval Tools](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive), researchers can simulate and restore the evaluation process for each individual town to compute the corresponding metrics.
