# README

This folder contains two subdirectories: `DiverseChallengingScenarios` and `FailureScenarios`. These correspond to the representative scenarios described in **Appendix E** of the paper:
- **Representative Cases in Diverse and Complex Scenarios**
- **Limitations and Failure Case Analysis**

## DiverseChallengingScenarios/

This folder presents a selection of representative scenarios from the 220 closed-loop evaluation episodes in the **Bench2Drive** benchmark. These scenarios highlight the model's performance in a wide range of complex and challenging conditions, including:

- Extreme weather (e.g., fog, rain)
- Varying time-of-day (daytime, nighttime)
- Complex urban scenes (e.g., merging, overtaking, intersections, traffic light interactions)

These cases demonstrate the modelâ€™s end-to-end performance and its learned causal reasoning capabilities under diverse operational conditions.

## FailureScenarios/

This folder includes two representative failure scenarios referenced in the main paper. These examples reflect limitations observed during closed-loop evaluation and provide meaningful insights for future model improvements.

In all videos:
- `wp` denotes the **predicted waypoints** generated by the model.
- `target` indicates the **mid-range goal points** provided by the global route planner in the simulation environment.

These examples illustrate how the vehicle plans its trajectory relative to the intended path and adjusts in response to the environment.
